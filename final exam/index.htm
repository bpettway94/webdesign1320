            <p>My husbands name is Daniel, but he goes by "dan the man" (not really but we call him that a lot lol!) We have known each other since the Highschool, but reconnected during the pandemic. We became close quick. I can't tell you how lucky i am to be married to a man who supports your every goal and dream! .</p>
