            <h2>I'm so glad to meet you!!</h2>
            <p>Now that you have seen some of my family, let me tell you a little about me. I started my photography business back in 2014. I has been a big rollercoaster of ups and downs, but i think i am finally on the "up" side of everything. The past 4 years i have had the pleasure of traveling all across the country. To Europe, Ierland, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Honduras,Hawaii, Puerto Rico and many more. On top of that i have been to almost 40 states in the US! I passion myself on wedding photography, but i also do lifestyle and families! I learned everything i know in school and at workshops. I consider myself a documentary photogrpaher. I hope you enjoyed learing a little more about me!</p>
