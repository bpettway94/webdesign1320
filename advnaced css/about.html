            <p>Trees have many different uses. Trees may be ornamental in nature. Beautiful looking trees with brightly coloured and fragrant flowers are usually planted as ornamental trees. Trees are also ornamental in nature if their flowers or fruits have a unique shape or colour. For example, the flowers and fruit of the canon ball tree are unique.</p>

            <p>There are trees that have medicinal uses. Certain parts of trees may be of medicinal value. The neem tree, for instance, which is native to India, is used as a curative for many health conditions. Trees also have cultural and religious significance. There are communities that respect and worship trees. The peepal tree, for example, is a tree that is highly revered and worshipped. Trees are also food for man. Tree parts such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds may be edible. All herbivorous and omnivorous animals also depend on trees for their food. Trees are also home to many different animals, birds, reptiles and insects. Birds build their homes in trees. Insects like bees and butterflies swarm to the fragrant flowers on trees. This helps in pollination that helps flowers turn into fruits. Bee hives in trees are also the source of honey. Trees must be protected. Felling of trees must be avoided. Trees serve to maintain ecological and environmental balance and equilibrium. As trees take a long time to grow, deforestation cannot be rectified quickly. Besides, the benefits of pristine forest cover cannot be replicated easily by planting trees.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>There are many different types of trees that grow. Trees are food for man and all herbivorous animals. The roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds of trees may be edible. Trees are also home to many wildlife species. Animals seek the shade and shelter of trees. Birds build their nests in trees. Reptiles and insects also live in trees. Trees help in binding the soil. Trees and forests also play a role in maintaining the hydrological cycle and rainfall patterns. Trees are Natureâ€™s bounty. We must not cut down trees. We must protect trees, and help grow more trees.</p>

            <p>Trees give us many benefits. Trees are the green cover of the planet. Trees need water, sunshine and air to grow. The process of photosynthesis that occurs in trees, that helps them grow, uses oxygen and gives out carbon-dioxide. Thus, they contribute to the oxygen in the air that we need to breathe to stay alive. They also use up the carbon-dioxide that is present in the air, and thus prevent the accumulation of the greenhouse gas that leads to global warming and climate change.</p>

            <h3>Who Knows, we love trees</h3>
            <p>When seeds and saplings are planted and grow into trees, they make a place greener and more beautiful. Attractive, colourful and sweet-smelling flowers bloom on trees. Trees may grow to be very tall, or may be short in height. Trees provide shade. They are also home to many animals, birds, reptiles and insects. Animals run up trees to save themselves from predators. Birds build their nests in trees. Butterflies and bees also visit the flowers that bloom on a tree</p>
