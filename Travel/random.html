        <h2>Just GO!</h2>

WELL, its time to pick a place for you and your family, or if your down for a solo trip, just you! are youb looking for sun and waves? the dry desert with a ton of culture? or maybe you just want a fun hiking adventure!

        <h3>Last but not Least!</h3>
        <p>My last (but not least) for my top 4 places to visit, would be russia! Gosh there is so much to love about this country, from the food, to the people, listenting to the music, it was all just a blast. I just higly reccomend going during the summer and not the winter, simple becuase it is a harsh and cold winter. With that i will point out my last topic for traveling. Make SURE to check for the "right" time to travel, you don't want to plan a vaction to mexico during hurricane season, or a trip to Whyoming during fire season. So do lots of research before you plan. That way you can pack accordingly and know exatly what to expect!</p>
