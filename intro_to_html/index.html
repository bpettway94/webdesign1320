    <h2>Welcome to My Site</h2>
    <p> As a child growing up we went to the beach often, this was my happy place. 
        I remember the sounds of the waves crashing against the shore, 
        the feel of the sand beneth my toes, and the salty wind in my hair. These memories are so important to me.
        why you might ask? Well becuase this was the time as a child my family never foguht, me and my siblings always 
        got along, There were no sports events to go to, no dead lines to meet, and it was just a hapy time. You might think my childhood was bad from 
        the way it sounds, but it wasnt all bad. I had the good mom, and the hard working dad, the two family home with 
        the perfect siblings. But i also had the childhood that was centered around sports and academics, so my childhood 
        was never "fun". The vacation and the beach was a happy place, our life for a few days was calm, just like the ocean.

    <p> "THE OCEAN BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE 
        The Ocean has its silent caves,
        Deep, quiet, and alone;
        Though there be fury on the waves,
        Beneath them there is none.
        The awful spirits of the deep
        Hold their communion there;
        And there are those for whom we weep,
        The young, the bright, the fair.
        Calmly the wearied seamen rest
        Beneath their own blue sea.
        The ocean solitudes are blest,
        For there is purity.
        The earth has guilt, the earth has care,
        Unquiet are its graves;
        But peaceful sleep is ever there,
        Beneath the dark blue waves." 
    
        I just love this poem, i have it hanging in my bedroom over a bottle of sand and shells. It reminds me how powerful
        and strong the ocean is, but at the same time how serene and calm it can be. To me the ocean is just a wild and 
        undiscovered place filled with wonders we could only ever dream about. Hoepefully one day we will be able to see them.
